Bot checking if xbox series x is available in Canada, you must be in front of your computer. You still have to add it to your cart and checkout. Otherwise, wouldn't be fair.

## How to make sure you get it?
* Connect to your microsoft account on your default browser
* Set your address and payment method
* Start bot
* Wait for the music and the automatic window opening
* Click next, next, buy, I think you get it :)
* Enjoy your xbox in like 5 days for shipping ;)
